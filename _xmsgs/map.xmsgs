<msg type="error" file="Place" num="1205" delta="new" >This design contains a global buffer instance, &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">sys_pll_m0/clkout2_buf</arg>&gt;, driving the net, &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">sdram_clk_OBUF</arg>&gt;, that is driving the following (first <arg fmt="%d" index="3">30</arg>) non-clock load pins off chip.
<arg fmt="%s" index="4">&lt; PIN: sdram_clk.O; &gt;
</arg>This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution: instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to .C1. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. Although the net may still not route, you will be able to analyze the failure in FPGA_Editor.
